# GOVERNANCE_RULES

## Development Workflow
- All changes must be documented in the `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Large changes require a `BUILD_PLAN.yaml`.
- Architectural shifts must be recorded in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.

## Quality Standards
- No linting errors allowed in production builds.
- TypeScript must be used for all new logic.
- CSS must follow the established utility-first or component-based pattern.
